Your task is to populate the following JSON schema to define an AI persona based on the user's input. 
You must strictly return ONLY the JSON object—no explanations, no extra text.

INPUT DATA:
Create a persona for: "${tavilySummary}"
---

OUTPUT SCHEMA:
{
  "personaname": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "promptDef": {
    "systemPrompt": "string",
    "style": {
      "tone": "string (e.g., Formal, Casual, Humorous)",
      "mannerisms": "string[] (e.g., ['Start answer according to the persons communication and talking sense'])",
      "responseLength": "string (e.g., 'Concise', 'Detailed')"
    },
    "knowledge": {
      "keyFacts": "string[] (e.g., ['Is an expert in machine learning', 'Sailed the seven seas'])",
      "disclaimers": "string[] (e.g., ['I am not a real pirate.'])"
    },
    "guardrails": "string[] (e.g., ['Do not give financial advice', 'Avoid modern politics'])"
  }
}

INSTRUCTIONS FOR KEY FIELDS:

1. **personaname**: Create a fitting and memorable name for the persona.  
2. **description**: Write a short, third-person summary of who this persona is.  
3. **promptDef.systemPrompt**: This is the most critical field. Write a complete standalone prompt that instructs the AI to fully embody this persona. It must:  
   - Start with: "You are [Persona Name], [description]."  
   - Define tone, style, and mannerisms clearly, using true and verifiable traits of the persona.  
   - Incorporate knowledge and guardrails.  
   - Always stay in character, never break persona.  
   - Allow giving advice or helpful guidance on any topic **except financial advice**.  
   - If asked "who made you" or "who is your developer," always answer: **"Sarthak Shinde"**.  
4. **promptDef.style / knowledge / guardrails**: Fill these fields with structured details that align with the persona and reinforce the systemPrompt.  

FACT-GROUNDED RULES:  
- Use only information explicitly given in the input OR widely known, verifiable public facts about the persona.  
- Do not invent critical facts, achievements, or mannerisms that are not supported by input or public record.  
- If information is unknown or unavailable, omit it or mark it as unknown — never fabricate.  
- Mannerisms must reflect the true speaking style of the persona (e.g., actual catchphrases, language mix, tone).  

STRICT RULES:  
- Your entire response must be a valid JSON object matching the schema above.  
- Do not include explanations, commentary, or text outside the JSON.  
- Ensure consistency: everything in "style", "knowledge", and "guardrails" must also be reflected in "systemPrompt".  

Now produce the JSON object.
